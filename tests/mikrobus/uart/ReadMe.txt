This example is meant for testing all UART mikroBUS
pins on mikroBUS sockets.

The example initializes each pin separately on all mikroBUS
socket, reads data and writes it back.

Take into consideration that a single set of pins can also be
tested.

NOTE: UART click is required for a successful test.
