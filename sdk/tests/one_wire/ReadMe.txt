Example is meant for testing One Wire protocol using mikroSDK 2.0

If board exists, pins can be defined using following macro template:

* Define desired one wire pin
    * #define TEST_PIN_ONE_WIRE MIKROBUS_1_PWM
* Define desired signal pin
    * #define TEST_PIN_SIGNAL_SUCCESS MIKROBUS_5_SCK

Go step by step through the example and follow instructions for testing.
