This example is meant for testing all I2C mikroBUS
pins on mikroBUS sockets.

The example initializes each pin separately on all mikroBUS
socket, writes data, reads it and compares it.

Take into consideration that a single set of pins can also be
tested.

NOTE: EEPROM click is required for a successful test.
