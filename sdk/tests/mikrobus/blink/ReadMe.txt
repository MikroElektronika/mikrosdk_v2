This example is meant for testing all mikroBUS
sockets on MikroE boards.

The example initializes all pins on all mikroBUS
sockets and toggles them on/of in ordered sequence.

Test is considered successful if all diodes on
mikroBUS sockets turn on/off starting from mikroBUS1 to
the last mikroBUS socket on board being tested.

NOTE: `TESTER click` boards required for conducting this test.
