This example is meant for testing all PWM mikroBUS
pins on mikroBUS sockets.

The example initializes each pin separately on all mikroBUS
socket, changes duty cycle value from max to min in
defined step cycle value.

Take into consideration that a single pin can also be
tested.

NOTE2: TESTER clicks might be required for a successful test.
However, if system has LED's on ports, no additional HW is
required.
