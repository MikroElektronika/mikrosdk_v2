### New features

#### mikroSDK

+ Added variations of the standard C `sprintf` function:
  + `sprintf_me()`
    + Full implementation supporting integers, floats, characters, and strings
    + Used to format and store detailed strings from various data types
  + `sprintl_me()`
    + Extended version of `sprinti_me()` supporting long decimal values
    + Useful for creating strings that include large numeric values
  + `sprinti_me()`
    + Lightweight version for basic types (integers, characters, strings), optimized for minimal code size in embedded systems
    + Ideal for embedded systems needing minimal memory usage
  + These functions are used to convert values (like numbers or characters) into a formatted string â€” similar to the standard
    C sprintf, but tailored for embedded systems
