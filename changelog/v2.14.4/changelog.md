### New features

#### mikroSDK

+ Added variations of the standard C `sprintf` function:
  + `sprintf_me()`
    + Full implementation supporting integers, floats, characters, and strings
    + Used to format and store detailed strings from various data types
  + `sprintl_me()`
    + Extended version of `sprinti_me()` supporting long decimal values
    + Useful for creating strings that include large numeric values
  + `sprinti_me()`
    + Lightweight version for basic types (integers, characters, strings), optimized for minimal code size in embedded systems
    + Ideal for embedded systems needing minimal memory usage
  + These functions are used to convert values (like numbers or characters) into a formatted string â€” similar to the standard
    C sprintf, but tailored for embedded systems

### Fixes

#### mikroSDK

+ Updated UART logger
  + Improved error handling during UART module initialization
  + Configured macros for pin mapping and additional options to use interrupt mode by default
+ Fixed the TFT_BPWM pin for boards EasyPIC PRO v8 and EasyAVR PRO v8
+ Fixes for PIC18FxxQ8x MCUs
  + Corrected certain register addresses, resolving I2C communication issues
  + Updated relevant regex patterns to ensure compatibility with *mikroC AI for PIC*
+ Fixed clock setting for USB in tinyUSB implementation for STM32L4
    + For STM32L47x/L48x clock source for USB should be set to PLLQ

#### CORE

+ Fixed USB clock schemes for STM32L47x/L48x
