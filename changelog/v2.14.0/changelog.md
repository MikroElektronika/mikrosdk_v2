**Supported modules:**

+ ADC (Full module support)
+ SPI (Full module support)
+ UART (Full module support)
+ I2C (Full module support)
+ PWM (Full module support)
+ GPIO (Full module support)
+ OW (Full module support)

### New Features

#### mikroSDK

+ Added functions to retrieve appropriate pin number and port name based on pin
  + Two functions in total:
    + `hal_gpio_fetch_pin`
    + `hal_gpio_fetch_port`
  + Both functions defined as static inline inside main gpio header file for ease of use
  + For example, pin `GPIO_PC3` can be used to retrieve pin number as `3` and port name as `GPIO_PORT_C`
+ Implemented UART polling mode
  + Introduced UART polling mode as an alternative to the existing interrupt-based approach in the mikroSDK
  + Provides an option for applications that require simpler control and do not rely on interrupt-driven operations

### Improvements

#### mikroSDK

+ Improved low level STM32 PWM implementation
  + Timer modules can now use the same module but different channels without reinitializing the module every time
  + Check [THIS EXAMPLE](../../tests/pwm/multi_channel) to see how it works
+ Added LCD_TFT macros into headers for all Mikromedias that don't use SIBRAIN socket the same way it is implemented for MCU Cards
  + Previously LCD_TFT macros were defined in CMakeLists.txt for TFTs
+ Added `errata` section in PIC32 low level implementation
  + Workarounds from the errata are now grouped and clearly marked for easier reference and maintenance

### Fixes

#### mikroSDK

+ Corrected UART stop bit configuration for STM32
  + The support for 0.5 and 1.5 stop bits on UART4 and UART5 for certain MCUs was previously overlooked
  + This issue has now been addressed in the code
+ Updated low-level I2C implementation
  + Some of the return value variables were originally declared as 8-bit, but they needed to handle larger values
  + This has now been fixed

#### CORE

+ Fixed STM32H7 library
  + Previously initialization process was stuck in infinite loop while waiting for PLL to be enabled
  + In project setup configuration clock settings values are now correct

### NEW HARDWARE
