## About

**mikroSDK 2.0** is an embedded software development framework designed to simplify</br>
and accelerate application development on **Mikroe** hardware platform,</br>
specifically for [**Click Boards&trade;**](https://github.com/MikroElektronika/mikrosdk_click_v2) and other extension board drivers, on a wide range</br>
of microcontroller vendors and architectures. It includes peripheral libraries</br>
and drivers, middleware, board support, and application layer libraries like</br>
Graphic Library, Visual TFT, Logger, Console and many more to come (eg. HID, FAT32 etc.).</br>
It also comes with examples and user documentation. **mikroSDK 2.0** applications can</br>
be reused on any **mikroSDK 2.0** compatible platform.

**mikroSDK 2.0** platform can be extended by Components which are [**Click Boards&trade;**](https://github.com/MikroElektronika/mikrosdk_click_v2) and</br>
other extension board drivers.

Board support comes with definitions for pin connections between microcontroller,</br>
MCU card and board sockets (eg. [**mikroBUS&trade;**](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus)) and special function pinouts,</br>
so you can easily map your driver or application to the board.

The peripheral driver library simplifies and unifies usage of microcontrollers,</br>
so reading a microcontroller's user manual, in most cases, is not necessary.</br>
It also allows writing portable and re-usable applications.

## Design Goals

- Standard C.
	- Large code base can be easely reused with other platforms (Linux, Arduino).
- Fast development.
	- Simplify developing applications with portability, fast prototyping in mind,</br>
	  minimal impact on performance.
- Ease of use.
	- Simplifies the usage of microcontrollers, providing an abstraction to the</br>
	  hardware and high-value middleware.
- Layered and modular software architecture.

## Peripheral Libraries (HAL)

Provides common peripheral functionality, abstracting the hardware peripheral</br>
register access. The interface hides the register access details and various</br>
MCU peripheral instantiation differences so that the application can be</br>
abstracted from the low-level hardware details.

## Peripheral Drivers (DRV)

The Driver specification is a software API which describes peripheral driver</br>
interfaces for middle-ware stacks and user applications. It adds higher level</br>
functionality, implementing common protocols, handling multiple clients for</br>
peripheries and their re-initialization.

## Components

Wide range of reusable driver libraries for [**Click Boards&trade;**](https://github.com/MikroElektronika/mikrosdk_click_v2) and</br>
extension boards. The component should use peripheral drivers (DRV) to</br>
communicate with MCU peripherals and board support to port driver to/br>
specific pin mappings.

## Board support

Board support consists of pin mappings for sockets and other special function</br>
pins. It maps specific board pins to MCU target pins. It can also contain other</br>
useful information necessary for drivers to work properly on the board.

## API

High level libraries for commonly used services, so developers do not need to</br>
reinvent the wheel, shortening development cycles. It comes with new improved</br>
Graphic library, Visual TFT library for GUI applications, Logger,</br>
Console framework, Input library, and many more to come.

## Key Features

* Application framework for abstraction and code re-usability.
* Layered architecture.
* Simplified microcontroller common usage.
* Easy development of Click drivers.
