# Mandatory rules regarding the project workflow:
- Each intern should work on his/her own branch named as name.surname/project_name_example
- Every working state of the project should be immediately pushed to your git branch
    - Every time you have the state of project that doesn't work and you don't know what you did wrong you can `git stash` the changes and go back to the working version of project
- On your branch you must have a file called "name_surname_weekly_report.md" that has all the information about your every work week (see an example [here](./name_surname_weekly_report.md))
    - Every time you make changes to your branch, add the information about new changes
        - Don't keep in your weekly report the info about things that you removed
    - Arrange your report using as many markdown file features as you can
        - Links to the folders/files are obligatory
- Add in the [Changelog.md](./Changelog.md) file the main features that were added
    - It shouldn't be as detailed as weekly report but should have the information about the features that were added
